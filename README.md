# Sentiment-Analysis

Sentiment analysis focuses on the polarity of a text (positive, negative, neutral) but it also goes beyond polarity to detect specific feelings and emotions (angry, happy, sad, etc), urgency (urgent, not urgent) and even intentions (interested v. not interested).

Depending on how you want to interpret customer feedback and queries, you can define and tailor your categories to meet your sentiment analysis needs.

Graded Sentiment Analysis
If polarity precision is important to your business, you might consider expanding your polarity categories to include different levels of positive and negative:

Very positive
Positive
Neutral
Negative
Very negative
This is usually referred to as graded or fine-grained sentiment analysis, and could be used to interpret 5-star ratings in a review, for example:

Very Positive = 5 stars
Very Negative = 1 star
Emotion detection
Emotion detection sentiment analysis allows you to go beyond polarity to detect emotions, like happiness, frustration, anger, and sadness.

Many emotion detection systems use lexicons (i.e. lists of words and the emotions they convey) or complex machine learning algorithms.

One of the downsides of using lexicons is that people express emotions in different ways. Some words that typically express anger, like bad or kill (e.g. your product is so bad or your customer support is killing me) might also express happiness (e.g. this is bad ass or you are killing it).

# Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis
Usually, when analyzing sentiments of texts you’ll want to know which particular aspects or features people are mentioning in a positive, neutral, or negative way.

That's where aspect-based sentiment analysis can help, for example in this product review: "The battery life of this camera is too short", an aspect-based classifier would be able to determine that the sentence expresses a negative opinion about the battery life of the product in question.

# Multilingual sentiment analysis
Multilingual sentiment analysis can be difficult. It involves a lot of preprocessing and resources. Most of these resources are available online (e.g. sentiment lexicons), while others need to be created (e.g. translated corpora or noise detection algorithms), but you’ll need to know how to code to use them.

Alternatively, you could detect language in texts automatically with a language classifier, then train a custom sentiment analysis model to classify texts in the language of your choice.

# Why Is Sentiment Analysis Important?
Since humans express their thoughts and feelings more openly than ever before, sentiment analysis is fast becoming an essential tool to monitor and understand sentiment in all types of data.

Automatically analyzing customer feedback, such as opinions in survey responses and social media conversations, allows brands to learn what makes customers happy or frustrated, so that they can tailor products and services to meet their customers’ needs.

For example, using sentiment analysis to automatically analyze 4,000+ open-ended responses in your customer satisfaction surveys could help you discover why customers are happy or unhappy at each stage of the customer journey.

Maybe you want to track brand sentiment so you can detect disgruntled customers immediately and respond as soon as possible. Maybe you want to compare sentiment from one quarter to the next to see if you need to take action. Then you could dig deeper into your qualitative data to see why sentiment is falling or rising.

The overall benefits of sentiment analysis include:

# Sorting Data at Scale
Can you imagine manually sorting through thousands of tweets, customer support conversations, or surveys? There’s just too much business data to process manually. Sentiment analysis helps businesses process huge amounts of unstructured data in an efficient and cost-effective way.

# Real-Time Analysis
Sentiment analysis can identify critical issues in real-time, for example is a PR crisis on social media escalating? Is an angry customer about to churn? Sentiment analysis models can help you immediately identify these kinds of situations, so you can take action right away.

# Consistent criteria
It’s estimated that people only agree around 60-65% of the time when determining the sentiment of a particular text. Tagging text by sentiment is highly subjective, influenced by personal experiences, thoughts, and beliefs.

By using a centralized sentiment analysis system, companies can apply the same criteria to all of their data, helping them improve accuracy and gain better insights.
